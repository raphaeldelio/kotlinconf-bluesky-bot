    "## Overview of Previous Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks, we've built a pipeline for processing Bluesky posts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **JetStream Consumer**: We consumed Bluesky's Jetstream Websocket and inserted events into a Redis Stream.\n",
    "2. **JetStream Filtering**: We filtered events using Redis Bloom Filter for deduplication and a machine learning model for content-based filtering.\n",
    "3. **Events Enrichment**: We enriched the filtered events with topic modeling and embeddings for semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Build in This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a simple question-answering system that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify trending topics in the posts\n",
    "2. Perform semantic search to understand user queries\n",
    "3. Summarize posts about specific topics using a Large Language Model (LLM)\n",
    "4. Route different types of user queries to the appropriate handler\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how to combine Redis, vector search, and LLMs to build an intelligent data analysis system."
